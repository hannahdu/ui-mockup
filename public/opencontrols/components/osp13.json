					"text": "'Red Hat OpenStack inherits many memory protections provided\nby the underlying operating system. When running on Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux, such kernel-level memory protections\nhave undergone Common Criteria Certification.\n\nCertain hypervisors use memory optimization techniques that overcommit\nmemory to guest virtual machines. This is a useful feature that allows\ndeployment of very dense computer clusters. One approach to this\ntechnique is through deduplication or sharing of memory pages.\n\nWhen two virtual machines have identical data in memory, there are\nadvantages to having them reference the same memory. Typically this\nis achieved through Copy-On-Write (COW) mechanisms, such as kernel\nsame-page merging (KSM), These mechanisms are vulnerable to certain\nattacks.\n\nMemory deduplication systems are vulnerabile to side-channel attacks.\nIn academic studies, attackers were able to identify software packages\nand versions running on neighboring virtual machines as well as\nsoftware downloads and other sensitive information through analyzing\nmemory access times on the attacker Virtual Machine. Consequently, one\nVirtual Machine can infer something about the state of another, which\nmight not be appropriate for multi-tenant environments where not all\ntenants are trusted or share the same levels of trust.\n\nMore importantly, row-hammer type attacks have been demonstrated\nagainst KSM to enact cross-Virtual Machine modification of\nexecutable memory. A hostile instance could gain code execution\naccess to other instances on the same Compute host.\n\nDeployers should disable KSM if strong project separation (as\nwith public clouds and some private clouds) is required.\n\nTo disable KSM, refer to:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/virtualization_tuning_and_optimization_guide/#sect-KSM-Deactivating_KSM'\n"
